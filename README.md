Most of this repository contains various geometry and macro files related to my experimentation with converting FIT geometry to something readable by EVE. Of interest are only two macros:

- [make_simple_geom_ft0.C](utils/make_simple_geom_ft0.C) which allows for converting full FT0 geometry from O2 simulation run to a simplified one
- [make_simple_geom_fv0.C](utils/make_simple_geom_fv0.C) which allows for converting full FV0 geometry from O2 simulation run to a simplified one

Note that both macros require geometry created by simulation **OF ONLY ONE DETECTOR**.
